He has contributed to projects in distrubuted storage, blockchain core infrastructure, and protocol-level research, for ecosystems including Solana, Polkadot, and several DeFi protocols. Blessed is passionate about building decentralized systems and sharing knowledge with the community. Currently, Blessed is leading research at Zendfi, focusing on scalable interoperability and privacy. He swears he’s a Twitter master, but the man’s still out there treating DMs like some mystery scroll. We’ve actually never questioned his claim… mostly because we’re afraid he might try to @ us in real life (that's if he even knows how to. 😂)"
