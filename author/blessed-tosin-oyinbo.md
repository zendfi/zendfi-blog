He has contributed to projects in distrubuted storage, blockchain core infrastructure, and protocol-level research, for ecosystems including Solana, Polkadot, and several DeFi protocols. Blessed is passionate about building decentralized systems and sharing knowledge with the community.

He swears he’s a Twitter master, but the man’s still out there treating DMs like some mystery scroll. We’ve actually never questioned his claim… mostly because we’re afraid he might try to @ us in real life (that's if he even knows how to. 😂)"
